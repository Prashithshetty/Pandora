# Pandora
A mobile/web app that acts like a live culture guide:

You point your phone at a location or search for a place.

The app pulls verified stories, art, and history about that place from the internet.

Locals can submit their own stories/photos, which the app auto-checks (time, location, matching online sources).

You can use AR to preview artworks on your wall or see a cultural marker appear when you visit the spot.

If you like what you see, you can connect with artists or request a custom piece.
